# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview

My project is a tool for memory training. It will not be the conventional “memory training app” or “brain trainer” which typically consists of nothing but memory games. My app is focused on a specific technique used by world memory champions (people who must remember thousands of digits within a very short time). The name of the technique is PAO and stands for Person Action Object. Essentially you associate a certain person/action/object with a number, and it allows you to turn the abstract number into a colorful image or story.

The hard part about using a PAO system is typically you have to make it yourself and I have not found an easy application to do this on because it is such a niche topic. Most turn to Microsoft Excel for its structure but this is very lacking in its usability, because it’s not set up for this system. My app will not only make creating PAO’s much easier for people, but also allow them to share their PAOs with others and even train their knowledge of their own PAO. My idea for this project came when I was getting into memory sports but found no easy way to make my own PAO.


### Features

1.	User login/registration: Users will have their own account where they can create and edit their own PAOs as well as share them with others via Posts.

2.	Create PAO: Users will be able to define how big their PAO is, give it a title, upload images to each number for each category (Person, Action, Object). PAOs will be saved to a database.

3.	Train PAO: Users will be able to type in a number and see what Person, Action, Object appears. As well as being presented with an image and seeing what number that image represents (flip card like quizlet).

4.	View/Import PAOs: Users will be able to post their own PAO but also view and save other people’s PAOs to their account. Once saved they will be able to edit those PAOs.

5.	Killer UI:  Website will be responsive and have a natural feel to it. I want to follow the recommended UI/UX design guidelines to make the website feel professional. 


### Technologies

•	HTML/CSS
•	JavaScript
•	Maybe Java?
•	Spring Boot
•	MongoDB
•	React

### What I'll Have to Learn

Heavy JavaScript and React, I'm not terribly familiar with either but I am familiar with Java and from what I've seen JS isn't terribly different in its syntax. Also MongoDB I've never used before so I will have to become familiar with that. I'll also need to up my Spring Boot game. HTML/CSS I'm pretty confident with.
